## Demo

https://django-astrowind.netlify.app/

## Getting Started

- If you haven't launched the `Django-headless-cms` backend yet, please refer to the [Introduction](https://django-headless-cms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) and follow the tutorials.

- Create a `.env` file from the [.env.TEMPLATE](.env.TEMPLATE) file, **then input your created CMS API key from your backend to VITE_CMS_API_KEY.**

> **_NOTE:_** VITE_CMS_API_KEY is required to fetch content, don't forget to get that one from backend.

- Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

- Run the following command to sync api schema (located at [src/schemas/](./src/schemas/content.ts)), schema type (located at [src/types/](./src/types/content.ts)) and the content (located at [src/contents/auto-\*](./src/content/)):

```bash
npm run sync:all
```

- If you want to sync content only, run this command:

```bash
npm run sync:content
```

- Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Deploy

#### Predeploy

> **_NOTE:_** Make sure you have deployed your `Django-headless-cms` backend. Then, create a **CMS API key** and save it for your deployment. Next, update your backend server URL in the [Production settings](./src/settings/production.settings.ts).

#### Deploy to production (manual)

- Update your [.env](.env) file (or export the environment variables):

```text
VITE_CMS_API_KEY=your-production-key
VITE_CMS_API_URL=https://your-production.url
```

-You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
VITE_APP_ENV=production npm run build
```

- Now, your website is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at
  `dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
  prefer.

> **_NOTE:_** Deployment to Vercel has not yet been updated to include the ability
> to fetch content and cache it. If you have knowledge about this, please feel free to contribute. Thank you!
